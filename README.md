# PandaTNTFusion

## Description

Attempts to combine TNT explosions in areas with lots of TNT explosions happening at once. This prevents the server from lagging very badly or crashing with large TNT explosions. This does make it so explosions do not have entirely vanilla behavior.

## Configuration

Under ./config/PandaTNTFusion.json

```
{
  "MaxTNNTPrimed": 200
}
```
Set the max amount of TNT primed in an area before they start to attempt to combine with enarby explosions
